Not because your parents want or your friend say you should. It's between the 2 of you to decide. Once decides to give birth, stand by your idea and make sure to look after and educate your child well. Seen cases of people deciding to give birth because parents' pressure then in the end blame parents when they face hardship bringing up the kids. Once decides to give birth, the responsibility is yours to take. Once decided not to give birth then make sure to communicate well with your partner on this decision. There are happy family with kids and lots of joy everyday. There are families without kids but still enjoy their life. There are families with kids and lots of trouble like adult child go gamble and keep asking parents for money. There are people with no kids and became alone and lonely in the older age. Either side should not try to influence each other for their decision. Ultimately, there is good and bad to both decision and you will never know which one will happen to you. So just be a parent when you think you are ready to be 1. Most sensible statement</td>\n",

       "13   I seen people who follow social norms, and been advising me to do so as well. but when I go to their house and see them frustrated with their children, i am wondering is it worth it. i seen people who love children, saints. i also seen a friend raising child because she don't want to become lonely  when they are old.  so she tried 3 times IVF in 40s, it cost her about 50k. her quality of living dropped quite drastically. her husband not supportive of having children, thus not very proactive in child issues, she face it alone although unhappy. she is tied to having to work for the next 20 years to support her child studies, and because she drained quite a lot of savings in IVF. now her child every night cry, she has to wake up comfort the child, causing sleep disturbance in her, everyday looking tired, she also hires a maid for her child. her kid becomes closer to everyone but not her because her time spent on working. is it worth it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

Not because your parents want or your friend say you should. It's between the 2 of you to decide. Once decides to give birth, stand by your idea and make sure to look after and educate your child well. Seen cases of people deciding to give birth because parents' pressure then in the end blame parents when they face hardship bringing up the kids. Once decides to give birth, the responsibility is yours to take. Once decided not to give birth then make sure to communicate well with your partner on this decision. There are happy family with kids and lots of joy everyday. There are families without kids but still enjoy their life. There are families with kids and lots of trouble like adult child go gamble and keep asking parents for money. There are people with no kids and became alone and lonely in the older age. Either side should not try to influence each other for their decision. Ultimately, there is good and bad to both decision and you will never know which one will happen to you. So just be a parent when you think you are ready to be 1. Most sensible statement  \n",
