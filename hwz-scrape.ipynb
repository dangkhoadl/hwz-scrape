Not because your parents want or your friend say you should. It's between the 2 of you to decide. Once decides to give birth, stand by your idea and make sure to look after and educate your child well. Seen cases of people deciding to give birth because parents' pressure then in the end blame parents when they face hardship bringing up the kids. Once decides to give birth, the responsibility is yours to take. Once decided not to give birth then make sure to communicate well with your partner on this decision. There are happy family with kids and lots of joy everyday. There are families without kids but still enjoy their life. There are families with kids and lots of trouble like adult child go gamble and keep asking parents for money. There are people with no kids and became alone and lonely in the older age. Either side should not try to influence each other for their decision. Ultimately, there is good and bad to both decision and you will never know which one will happen to you.

       "40   You can say it's norm - but what is wrong with norms? Like many stated, if perhaps your parents didn't follow norms, you may not exist. There are many other norms in life. Being nice to people in general is a norm. Not making a fool of yourself in public is a norm. Using Internet and chatting with other people is less, but still a norm, and increasingly so.

U can see now SG is very competitive. What about 10 years later? 20 years later? When your kid graduate and they cant find a job? Most of your money is spent on them, have you saved enough for your retirement? Best case scenario, they give u a few hundred to a few thousands per month for allowance.

If you don't have most of those, just admit you are not suitable to be a parent and we'll leave it that. What if you have all three but still don't want kids?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

Not because your parents want or your friend say you should. It's between the 2 of you to decide. Once decides to give birth, stand by your idea and make sure to look after and educate your child well. Seen cases of people deciding to give birth because parents' pressure then in the end blame parents when they face hardship bringing up the kids. Once decides to give birth, the responsibility is yours to take. Once decided not to give birth then make sure to communicate well with your partner on this decision. There are happy family with kids and lots of joy everyday. There are families without kids but still enjoy their life. There are families with kids and lots of trouble like adult child go gamble and keep asking parents for money. There are people with no kids and became alone and lonely in the older age. Either side should not try to influence each other for their decision. Ultimately, there is good and bad to both decision and you will never know which one will happen to you. So just be a parent when you think you are ready to be 1.

Was pre-ordering something for a friend. Since he thought he was delivering to a friend and wants my business, anyhow says item just arrived while other stores still havent. He gave an older model and get the money for the newer model. Asked for a refund since this kind of person tries to cheat people whenever possible. So I would rather give my business elsewhere. Instead gives a lot of excuses and reply slowly. I have no choice since I might not get my money back with the old model that I have, need to talk nicely and worst off, other shops already started selling days later and yet here I am with a delayed item that has yet to arrive. Finally, days later then received. Didn't know shopping can be this stressful. Never again. Don't ever give using bank transfers. Online shops with paypal is a lot safer. Or at least itsmine.pc. Never fails to deliver on the same day and no issues.</td>\n",

IF STRIX, just insist on a refund. You stand as good a chance of getting the card as him IF price is very much lower than MSRP, just ask for  refund. Same chances as above. If he order from mining stock, money is stuck there. If he refund you, means he will  have to eat the Graphic card IF and WHEN it arrives. Basically, GPU should take no longer than 3 days unless it is a STRIX This thread will be moved to Feedback Channel</td>\n",

Was pre-ordering something for a friend. Since he thought he was delivering to a friend and wants my business, anyhow says item just arrived while other stores still havent. He gave an older model and get the money for the newer model. Asked for a refund since this kind of person tries to cheat people whenever possible. So I would rather give my business elsewhere. Instead gives a lot of excuses and reply slowly. I have no choice since I might not get my money back with the old model that I have, need to talk nicely and worst off, other shops already started selling days later and yet here I am with a delayed item that has yet to arrive. Finally, days later then received. Didn't know shopping can be this stressful. Never again. Don't ever give using bank transfers. Online shops with paypal is a lot safer. Or at least itsmine.pc. Never fails to deliver on the same day and no issues.  \n",

IF STRIX, just insist on a refund. You stand as good a chance of getting the card as him IF price is very much lower than MSRP, just ask for  refund. Same chances as above. If he order from mining stock, money is stuck there. If he refund you, means he will  have to eat the Graphic card IF and WHEN it arrives. Basically, GPU should take no longer than 3 days unless it is a STRIX This thread will be moved to Feedback Channel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
