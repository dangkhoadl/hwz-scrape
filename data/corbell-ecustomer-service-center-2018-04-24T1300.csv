(J/K) Regarding RMA and sales/RMA reservation : Do not wish go too in-depth into this actually. Just note that standard RMA periods are usually 6-8weeks. It is basically an industry standard. The item is not sent individually which many have that misconception. Its accumulated and sent in bulk as a whole. More info, feel free to check with us More important part is this. Pertaining to RMA/sales reservation. I saw a big stack of cards and accessories ranging from GPUs for exchange, GPUs for loan, 24pin/8pin& SATA modular cables, and even case accessories. After checking with the tech guys, most were reserved by customers who called in to reserve because it was urgent. Some were from online users and some were for sales and purchase. All these ""reserved & urgent"" stuff will be released within a period of 7 days from now on. Some users called/PM to reserve saying it was urgent but never appear in the end or maybe they did come but didn't inform the tech guys. Some were for purchase, some for RMA. If you already had an arrangement prior to your visit, be it PM/call in, please identity youself or inform them when you are here so as to avoid any mis-communication. Updated*"

Although we are confident that the levels of reported power draws by the Radeon RX 480 do not pose a risk of damage to motherboards or other PC components based on expected usage, we are serious about addressing this topic and allaying outstanding concerns. Towards that end, we assembled a worldwide team this past weekend to investigate and develop a driver update to improve the power draw. We\u2019re pleased to report that this driver\u2014Radeon Software 16.7.1\u2014is now undergoing final testing and will be released to the public in the next 48 hours. In this driver we\u2019ve implemented a change to address power distribution on the Radeon RX 480 \u2013 this change will lower current drawn from the PCIe bus. Separately, we\u2019ve also included an option to reduce total power with minimal performance impact. Users will find this as the \u201ccompatibility\u201d UI toggle in the Global Settings menu of Radeon Settings. This toggle is \u201coff\u201d by default. Finally, we\u2019ve implemented a collection of performance improvements for the Polaris architecture that yield performance uplifts in popular game titles of up to 3%1. These optimizations are designed to improve the performance of the Radeon RX 480, and should substantially offset the performance impact for users who choose to activate the \u201ccompatibility\u201d toggle. AMD is committed to delivering high-quality and high-performance products, and we\u2019ll continue to provide users with more control over their product\u2019s performance and efficiency. We appreciate all the feedback so far, and we\u2019ll continue to bring further performance and performance/W optimizations to the Radeon RX 480."""

The sub latencies are different. You can't place a 3k or 3.2k MHz XMP and run A-XMP on Ryzen platforms without tweaking. In fact, it's more stable that you manually tweak your memory. Otherwise, you might like to wait for A-XMP memory modules to be released. *(Also for now, Ryzen only has 2 master OC dimms). Fyi. Cheers."

Its Cosair's policy as that model has EOL and replacing with a similar price range category. Which in your case, is the VX550W.

Usually if customer send through dealer for warranty claim, usually take longer time. FYI, standard RMA procedure for walk in, if no buffer for exchange, we will need to send back to MSI (waiting time around 8 weeks). We suggest that it would be better to alias with the shop and ask them check for you as to prevent any miscommunication and dispute. Thanks"

It seems to have given up on me - No fan light nor CPU booting when the power button is pressed. I understand that the usual warranty for this product is 5 years. May I know if it's possible to get it serviced for a fee? Hi, Regarding to your request, we sorry to inform you that for Seasonic RMA, we only do replacement for customer PSU that is within warranty. We don't do any repair over here. I suggest if possible get another PSU to test out computer or get your computer a check, just in case it is due to other component causes. Cheers"

It has a known issue - a sudden black/gray screen together with the last sound looping while running a game. The PC becomes totally unresponsive and I have to do a hard reset. Googling this has shown that it is a relatively common error among AMD 78xx card users. I have previously sent it in for RMA at the CORBELL office but they reported no detectable issues after testing so they returned the card to me. I would like to know if there are any GPU's with similar performance that I may exchange for this card. I believe the card is still under warranty (still have the original receipt). Thanks"

Hi there, You have to try to isolate the issue. As you mentioned that its more towards gaming and lines appear. You can stress test the vga and memory separately. ie,furmark, unigine for the GPU and memtst for the memory. And you noticed that it hangs when on load,(without bosd errors?) you can focus more on the VGA testing. If you suspect overheating, you can try dust clean the GPU heatsink fan and test it with the casing side panel removed. See if its better. If it runs fine, most likely just poor ventilation.(dust clogged up over time) If it still has issues, probably the GPU is haywired Bring it down for us to check/send it back for RMA."

If you have already register your warranty online then should be ok if you don't have the invoice with you. Should be during registration the system also ask for an upload of your invoice? For the fan noise you mentioned, need to let the service centre diagnose first then will know need to leave it there or can rectify on the spot.

The first time it spent almost two months in RMA just to fail with the same issue a week later. Currently, it has been been in RMA for just over a month, and I was hoping you could update me on what is going on?
