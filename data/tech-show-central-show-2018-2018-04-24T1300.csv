Trying not to sound like a fanboy, but Thinkpads come straight to mind. IMO, used Haswell Thinkpads give the best bang for buck right now; they're not too old yet, and those bought with extended warranty might even still be under warranty. They age gracefully anyway, unless abused really hard by the previous owner(s). Many of them also have vacant M.2 slots (no NVMe for this gen though, only SATA), so you can add a fast boot drive without having to spend a ton on a high capacity 2.5"" SSD."

I'll save the Aftershock fan boys the trouble and say that yes with that price I could have bought the 1070 S-17 but that card draws a whopping 210 watts of power! With so much heat produced in a thin chassis and virtually no review or benchmark of the machine performing under load and to see how effective its heat dissipation is, I'm not too optimistic about the longevity of those machines. 1060 maybe, but not the 1070. Picked Alienware cause they didn't skimp on their thermal management. I want the most bang for my buck."

If you're talking about the uneven core temperatures affecting the cpu, it was due to the thick thermal pads Alienware was using and has since been reaolved by Dell since December. That same forum on notebookreviews would tell you that. Disagree with regards to the Asus GL502 and 702 as they've been complaints by users in the Rog forums of excess heat throttling their cpus and gpus. I think the trade off for portability over thermal management shouldn't be so steep especially with such an expensive machine and why buy a machine only to have it neutered right out of the box. Of course with the G752, the thermals would probably be better (I wouldn't know because I can't afford that series hence no research) but you're also paying about 3.9k for their base line machine in that bracket according to the brochure. I had a MSI Ghost Pro before but the chassis got really hot during gaming. It's cpu and gpu were within acceptable temp ranges but I had to undervolt the cpu to get there. Hopefully the newer models are better. Never checked the Aorus out."

(2) Offer to pay in cash only - Only do this step after the above is done. Ask for a further discount. The vendor can save on credit card transaction cost (this is inclusive of NETS too). You may want to highlight this to the sales representative, or ask him to ask his supervisor. (3) Wait for the last day - It's a risky move, as you may not get the model you want. The vendors usually prefer to sell off all their products at the show than to bring it back to their shops (additional cost to transport the unsold products back).

Contrary to what some promoters have said in my years of visiting such tech shows - Not all i7 processors are the same - and there are Quad and Dual core variants available. Without going into the specifics since this is a buying guide after all, I shall just write the key things you need to take note of when buying a laptop (Intel & Nvidia based laptops) CPU: 1. Types of Processors Quote: There are 3 types of Processors are from Intel. They are the Intel i3, i5, i7 As a general rule of thumb, i7 is better than i5 which is better than i3 This is due to a variety of factors such as amount of cores, clock speed,  amount cache and turbo boost. With the exception of i3 CPU(s) which are only dual core, Both the i5 and i7 CPU(s) have dual and quad variants - though on the market, most i5 notebooks are dual cored. The later sections of this thread will explain how to tell the differences when you are looking at the specifications sheet to determine if it's a quad or dual core. 2. Naming Structure Quote: Let's take 3 Processors for instance. An Intel i7 6700HQ, i5 5200U & Intel i7 4720MQ 4720MQ 4 signifies that it is a 4th Generation MQ indicates that it is a Quad Core processor that is socketed and can be removed /replaced without changing the entire motherboard 5200U 5 signifies that it is a 5th Generation U indicates Ultra Low Voltage and Dual Core 6700HQ 6 signifies that it is a 6th Generation Processor HQ indicates Quad core processor that's soldered on to the motherboard. Quick tip! Q = Quad , U = Dual. 3. Do I need a Quad core or is Dual Core sufficient for my usage? Quote: This is a question that I am often asked the most and it has to depend on your usage patterns. A Dual Core U processor laptop is sufficient for most day to day usage situations - i.e. Web surfing, Report Writing, Light Gaming*, Video watching... A Quad Core Q processor is needed when you dwell into things that requires multi tasking - i.e. Rendering/ Photo-Video Editing. Being mobility devices, there is a trade off between performance and battery life with the rule of thumb being that a quad core processor would have better performance but slightly lesser battery life than a dual core processor. *Light gaming on titles such as Left 4 Dead 2 - on mid settings. GPU: 1. Types of GPU Quote: There are two types of graphics which can be found on one's notebooks Dedicated / Discrete and Integrated. Dedicated GPUs have built in memory onto it's card / chip, while Integrated GPUs uses memory from the laptop's ram - shared memory. Performance wise - though having said that there are performance improvements of Integrated GPUs over the years, Dedicated GPUs still do out perform Integrated GPUs. 2. Dedicated Graphics (Nvidia) Quote: GT - indicates consumer end with M indicating it to be a mobile GPU chip. First number indicates series / gen GT940M = 9th Gen Middle number indicates grade / range. Numbers from 1 to 3 indicate Low / Low mid range. Examples of low end mobile GPUs are GT920M Numbers 4 to 5 indicates Mid to Mid High Examples of mid range mobile GPUs are GT940M , GT950M Numbers 6 to 8 are often GTX series that offers high performance GTX - indicates enthusiast grade GPU. Examples are GTX960M, GTX970M 2. Which should I get Dedicated or Integrated? Quote: Similar to the dual vs quad core processor comparison, the same argument applies to dedicated vs integrated graphics. It boils down to usage patterns as well as the performance to battery life trade off. I would suggest getting a dedicated graphics owing to the flexibility of software and applications that can be done with having on board dedicated graphics."

I think it might be a good idea to help set expectations because I have seen some less than honest salespeople at these types of events hyping up the 'relativity' of different processors (e.g. Atom x is 'newer' and 'quad core' therefore it's better than an i5 dual core)."

Will do! I will have to read up more of those too - since the lines are blurred between the aforementioned processors mentioned by you. In general,  these are entry level processors - i.e. Quote: Atom: Found in Mobile / Hybrid tablets. Yes, they are now Quad! But in no way it can be comparable in terms of performance to an i5 notebook. Multi tasking can be done on a Quad atom - however there is a perform limit to it before it crawls and the limit is much much lower than an i5. Celeron / Pentium: For Entry level Notebooks Core M:  Performance sandwiched between i series (Upper) and Atom/Celeron/Pentium (Lower) processors. HardwareZone Forums app"

Do I need a printer that can print on both sides of a page? If Yes* - you would need a Duplex Printer. *Technically: You can print dual sided using a non duplex (single sided) printer as well - pointed out by a fellow forumer here - by printing single sided and flipping it the other way. For convenience, and the relatively low cost of Duplex printers however, it might be more convenient to purchase a Duplex Printer instead if you are a medium to heavy user who utilise duplex printing often. Do weigh the pros, cons and costs before considering either options. C2. Am I printing black & white pages mostly and minimal / no colour If Yes - Get a monochrome printer. If No - Get a laser colour / colour inkjet. Though colour lasers and laser printers in general have dropped in price, it is still expensive to purchase and to run too - there would be 4 toners in total - 3 for colours (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) , and 1 for black. C3. Do I need wireless printing or would it be plugged in to a stand alone PC and forgotten? Wireless printing works by sending your prints over your connected network then to the printer which then prints your queued document. It is more convenient if you have multiple users co sharing a printer i.e. home printer placed in a centralised location. All wireless printers have I/O for conventional usb printing should you need them. C4. Would it be cheaper to purchase a printer or print it at shops? Here are a few cost criterias that you would have to consider. 1. Toner costs - they do cost a fair bit but make it up in terms of pages that can be printed before toner replacement - certainly more affordable than an ink jet, and hey being a powder, it doesn't ""dry"" out like its ink counterparts. 2. Drum / Photo conductor cost - a drum is basically the component that picks up images and then transfers this image on to the paper. It lasts considerably longer than a toner - probably 3 - 5 times longer before needing to be replaced. In general a rule of thumb would be to. Take the cost of the toner and divide it by its page yield. For instance, a particular toner costs $90 and has a yield of 2600 pages. $90 / 2600 pages equals to $0.035 per page printed (Excluding paper, Drum per page costs and assuming negligible electrical cost ). C5. Do I need an ALL IN ONE? (Scan / Copy) A scanner can be useful at times for digitizing our documents such as receipts etc / quick duplication of documents. Good to have but adds to cost. Questions you should ask before purchasing. Quote: Q1. How many pages can this printer print? Q2. What is the toner yield and also is there any high yield toners available   for this model? Q3. How many pages later would the drum of the toner need to be replaced and at what cost? Q4. Lastly, any freebies? and got trolley? Hope this guide helps you out."

You are right! This is the method done before duplex was introduced to the mass market and when the technology for it was expensive. In my view if you are a low mileage printer who mostly prints a couple of pages a time, single sided. This can be a way to go. For users and students who print, the convenience of having a duplex function is worth the couple of $10s of dollars extra spent. It a hassle to do it though especially for a stack of printings 20 to 50 pages thick especially when you are printing 4 x 4 pdf / powerpoint slides. Orientation and order of pages would then be something one has to consider. Thanks for your point of view alamakazim! Could you suggest the software that you are using for it?

You have to look at the cost. In conventional laser printers, Drums and Toners are separate entities, i.e. to say that after 3 - 6 toner replacements would that you would then require 1 drum replacement. In some sense, it might be cheaper. A couple of formulas i typically use to calculate my costs are as follows - Formula 1: Toner cost / Toner yield (how many pages it can print)  to get cost per page. Formula 2: Assumption: 5 toner changes = 1 drum change. 5 x toner cost + 1 drum cost / Total yield (yield of 5 toners) For your case, if you were to pick an integrated toner and drum -  use formula 1.  Then compare it with formula 2 for the same page yield for a separate toner - drum printer hope this helps"

Bought it at USD89 with free delivery to Malaysia by FedEx. Originally it was USD199 when it was first launched. Later dropped to USD$149. And now dropped further to USD89. I think they are forced to drop the price because Taobao and Amazon are both selling at USD63~USD66 and they are ALL FAKE. Almost all headphones sold at third-party websites are fake. I think this is the reason Marshall has to drop the price crazily. Ironically, at Taobao and Amazon, even the fake ones are getting good reviews of 4.5/5.0.

Max volume? Probably higher. However don't forget your MW550 sub also has its own volume control. The Katana's volume control already reduce the volume before feeding to Katana's speakers and sub out, so the sub out volume is already (max voltage) minus (god knows how many dB). Then your MW550's own volume control takes that signal and minus (another god knows how many dB). So of course you will feel the volume is very low. In this kind of situation, the volume control of the receiving speaker (i.e. MW550) needs to be set to 0dB if you want the sub to be at the same loudness as the Katana speakers. This usually means at least 12 o'clock on the volume control and usually 2-3 o'clock."

Katana's outup (to sub) is at hi-level, meaning it is able to drive the sub's coil directly. And If I were to feed this signal to a lo-level input of the MW550. I dont think thats going to work well. Otherwise, there would not be hi-to-lo converters in the market, or also why some AMPs have hi-level inputs, while others just the usual lo-level ones. Also not to mention the risk of burning my inputs to my MW. So i dont think its possible to connect directly from katana -> MW550, without a level converter or w/o signal attenuation. cheers"

Yea they exist because there are situations where the amp is outputting >2V and you cannot change that. But if you're feeling the volume is too low means the amp is outputting too low a voltage even for driving the MW550 sub and you need to increase it. You're right, the situation is much simpler and post #14 already has a 1-liner solution."

Was using Draco HDT2-7300 for few years, worked well until conked out recently, unable to receive any signal (checked using other antennas so not antenna problem). Now they're selling a newer 7700 model, dunno if any better. The supplied Draco antenna (ANT-600A) is useless, couldn't pick up anything. Other minor quibble: Draco interface rather clunky, remote control buttons squeezed together so may accidentally press wrong button. Currently using Hyundai HDV-360 bought thru Qoo10 for 30 bucks, works great. Minor notes: doesn't come with any antenna, USB port at back of STB (inconvenient if plugging in & out frequently), remote con has tiny buttons and white lettering on light gray buttons makes it difficult to see which button. Dunno about other branded STBs but heard New Media Solutions one has copy protection ie cannot watch recorded programmes using other devices like PC. Actually think almost all STBs are much the same, more crucial is the antenna. Best is if on high floor, no surrounding high buildings and near to window, then cheap passive antenna also can. Those who like tinkering with stuff can try making DIY antenna, just google for instructions: personal experience from best to worst is dual bow-tie, coat hanger, fractal, binder clip. DIY antenna can be active if in STB settings select antenna power to be on. Don't look down on DIY antenna, their performance can thrash expensive store bought ones. Also note performance of any antenna can be affected by things like bad weather, interference from devices like amps & routers etc. If results still unsatisfactory or die die must have 100% always reliable signal, then no choice but buy good active antenna. Haven't used Daiyo ones so no comment but Funke Combo 5.1 is impressive. Can have smooth video even if signal quality in single digits for passive mode. Certainly best solid performance is as active antenna (USB adapter thingy is supplied), both signal quality & performance at 100%; I'm at low floor with TV almost 5m from window."

While these two are running,i can even stream on my iPhone using singtel go to watch  channels? Altogether three media device to watch at the same time? (2) How about recording? On your website,i only have option to choose rec dvr for the first set up box. Can my second tv user in the room (without set-top box) record tv shows from the room? If yes, does it mean that the second user can play back record shows remotely from the second tv too? (3) If I have 3 tvs, I should go for plan 2 right? This is so that I can watch from three tvs st the same time. Correct? (4) does your singtel set up box need direct fibre connection? My fibre termination point is on the ground floor while my tv is on the second. The data point on the second floor is far from the tv.

And so I braved the crowds at the IT SHOW in search of a wireless sport (sweat resistant) earphone which would basically fulfill three needs: 1. Does not fall from the ear easily. 2. Comfortable on the ear. 3. Decent sound quality (SQ) . The following were tried out: 1. Jabra Rox 2. Plantronics Go 3 3. Jaybird Freedom F5 - Smallest battery lifespan but the most comfortable and great SQ. 4. Creative Outlier Sport - best value for $ with Citibank CC. 5. Bose SoundSport - Great SQ. And the overall winner goes to... Jaybird Freedom! Light, stays in my ear (more so with their Comply earbuds, I dont even have to use the ear hook), not so protruding out from the ears, and great (and customisable) SQ. Downside is the battery life of course, but 4hrs (without the battery charger device connected) is adequate for my usage. From the start, I was sceptical of wireless earphones as they seem ever ready to fall out from my smaller than average ears anytime and I am glad I was wrong after trying out all the above. Emphasis on trying out as each person's ear anatomy and musical perception is different. Don't be shy to ask for a demo set to try out. If the ear buds are too big or small for your ear, ask for one which fits. All of the sales staff at the booths are patient and friendly, big thumbs-up to them especially the guy at Jaybird Best Denki booth."

What has MU-MIMO got to do with signal strength ? this one smoked too heavily liao LOL, MU-MIMO can go through wall meh? I think he mistaken it with beamforming. Quote: Multi-user, multiple-input, multiple-output technology\x97better known as MU-MIMO (a.k.a. Next-Gen AC or AC Wave 2)\x97allows a Wi-Fi router to communicate with multiple devices simultaneously. This decreases the time each device has to wait for a signal and dramatically speeds up your network. Considering that the average household has upwards of eight devices battling for bandwidth simultaneously, MU-MIMO will increasingly improve your Wi-Fi experience. For home Wi-Fi users, annoyances such as choppy video and continual buffering can really put a damper on the fun, but anyone who uses a Wi-Fi network will benefit from the performance improvements of MU-MIMO. Here are some of the ways MU-MIMO kicks common Wi-Fi problems to the curb: Both MU-MIMO and non-MU-MIMO (SU-MIMO) devices operate faster because all devices on the network have less time to wait to get data from the Wi-Fi router. MU-MIMO technology increases the capacity and efficiency of your router, allowing it to handle more Wi-Fi-intensive activities such as streaming and gaming."

It's assuming you live in a large landed property like in a US suburb - airy large house, with few concrete walls if any at all. Sure, the one device can service the whole house and even the garden. In an urban jungle like Singapore, you live in much smaller homes, much closer in proximity to your neighbors and likely have a very congested network channel. Not to mention there's a bomb shelter in every home, concrete walls, and walls that are in close proximity of each other, thereby making it difficult for wireless signals to propagate. So nevermind those marketing figures. Whether to buy a mesh networking router or a normal router depends on your available infrastructure and don't mind being more savvy to fine tune the router configurations. If your home has some LAN points laid out, it becomes a lot easier to consider multiple routers, assuming you're fine in dabbling with router configurations.

In this case, I think it makes it harder to decide and I think your house size and placement of fiber connection will help you in deciding whether to have 2 hops on the velop or just 1 on the Netgear. Disclaimer, I just got my Orbi over the weekend but yet to test it fully."

SSD (SATA)      -> Win 10 start up in 9 secs SSD (M.2)      -> Win 10 start up in 3 secs Bios boot time is roughly guessed, it depend on what you set to motherboard. i.e fastboot, etc. Once you get M.2, you will not go back to SATA SSD. M.2 also help in overall airflow, due to compactness and lack of messy power and sata cables. As shut down of PC is quicker than start up, not much saving in absolute time for shutdown... I think there is a misconception here. m.2 is merely a connection type. m.2 can be both SATA or PCIe NVMe. If your m.2 SSD is SATA, it is no different from a 2.5"" SATA SSD, except of course, in form factor. If your m.2 SSD is PCIe NVMe, then the story is different. It is much faster than SATA SSD, but the difference is not discernible to most users."

Now merchants are simply lazy. 1. Don't bother to check stocks 2. Don't bother to replenish stocks that are sold Seriously I don't know why they are there if their popular models are out of stocks. Waiting for durian to drop? Seriously using the same old method of selling products. Taobao and Amazon kill them left, right, center. In the end, kpkb to ministers saying difficult to compete etc... Then in this event where they cock it up, still don't want to offer some compensation. Really deserve to be slapped. They can provide excellent customer service by: 1. Informing customer they have no stock (likely customer tulan) 2. Replenish stock (confirm solid and make more $ for company but no one care) 3. Give some freebies in the event of cock up to delight customers In the end, seller didn't adopt any of these 3 and seriously make a lot of ppl pissed off!"

The MSI is about 2.8kg which is alot lighter than the Alienware but 17 inch laptops are most likely to stay on your desk most of the time, with their poor battery life and weight. You will need the power adapter on the road so the total weight will be close to 4-5kg."

They'll not comment on that. If you're in no hurry, you can wait, but like I've mentioned, it's unlikely to see price reductions. Even if you do see price reductions, it'll be minor - equal to the depreciation of your device if you purchase it now. Like Apple products, my personal recommendation is to buy them as soon as you can to enjoy the product sooner since the price is hardly going to change. You should also weigh the difference in experience you gain much earlier than to sticking to your old device for a longer time.

They'll not comment on that. If you're in no hurry, you can wait, but like I've mentioned, it's unlikely to see price reductions. Even if you do see price reductions, it'll be minor - equal to the depreciation of your device if you purchase it now. Like Apple products, my personal recommendation is to buy them as soon as you can to enjoy the product sooner since the price is hardly going to change. You should also weigh the difference in experience you gain much earlier than to sticking to your old device for a longer time. Thanks for the input!!"

If you are a tertiary student then you would be entitled to Free Office 365 (from your educational institution) - as long as your remain a student of the institution. Else, You would probably have to purchase / work out a deal with them for pwp office / freebies. Office is never cheap - but there are good alternatives out there such as Open office & Google's Doc/office/slides which are free. By default an office trial is installed on all laptops (so you can play around until the trial is over) A trend I have noticed through the shows is that Office 365 is being given as a ""Freebie"". May sound like a pretty sweet deal with the caveat being that it's pegged to a 12 month subscription and has to be renewed."

Got a call from them earlier in the afternoon. All who pre-ordered the monitors are supposed to receive an official email soon regarding the situation. But in a nutshell, what I was told regarding the Z270: 1. Design changes to the chassis cos existing one can be a bit flimsy. 2. Product improvement. Added speakers on monitor. (If I heard correctly) 3. Resulting in delay in shipment. Tentatively looking at 2nd week of May. 4. Customers who pre-ordered the monitor may have option to get refund if they decide not to get the monitors with these new design/improvements. I may not have heard the above 100% accurately. Better to wait for official email statement."

Most of the public think that they're looking at LED panels, and by extension, that the 'LED Panels' are what's giving them improved display quality.

As we all know now, and thanks to more detailed and accurate reporting by most tech news sources now, we know that 'QLED' is actually LCDs + a QD filter. From here, we'll also know that this is a much, much cheaper tech than OLED. And yet they tried to charge more for their QLCDs. Basically, what Samsung tried to do with their QD tech is to pull another 'LED TV' marketing farce. But like they've failed, because when OLED became mainstream, people understood the difference between these panels, and when QLED launched, people actively tried to understand how it worked as opposed to taking it at face value, and were educated about the difference, as we can tell from Samsung's inability to charge the QLCD screens at a higher price than OLED displays.

However, IMHO, we can only say one has been hoodwinked when for example one is getting something worse off at the same price. Where they stand now, they are offering a good alternative to OLED TVs - and not just in TV panel tech, but as a whole package. They are also not charging more as you've rightly pointed too. So at the end of the day, it depends which marketing wowed you more / which salesman did a better job / what one is personally inclined towards. It's business as usual. At the end of the day, the onus is upon consumers who have specific needs or expecting something specific to do their own homework. Else, the decision driver will flow towards which brand does a better job at marketing. For example, OLED TVs are fantastic in image quality, but frankly, LG's TVs are designed to wow rather than designed to inspire quality. They are rather fragile and those with kids, the TV better be out of reach for them. On the other hand Samsung does a great job in PQ generally (if you're not exactly comparing against an OLED), but the build quality is much better and more reassuring thanks to a more conventional design.  Same goes for the Sony equivalents too. That's not to say we won't recommend LG TVs - it's still the winner of 2016 and 2017 TVs by our books as we place a high emphasis on overall TV performance. However the recommendation based on pure performance isn't the first priority for everyone; when you're not doing a head-to-head comparison, at any given price point, most TVs look great on their own and they will certainly be many times better than what most people are upgrading from. As such, performance may not be the differentiating factor; features, design and price play a higher role for the average consumer. But as far as getting your hands on the best new tech for the same price, then yes, what you say holds true if nothing else is added to the equation. shadowoflight wrote: First 'hoodwink' - LED TVs have better picture quality because it's an LED display.

CEE (Best Denki) Price: $4299 (was $4599 but they match PC Show price for me) Free 48"" TV, Samsung sound bar, Samsung wireless keyboard, slim wall mount, $100 grocery vouchers. As you can probably see, CEE didn't give xBox. Not that I mind though. I just want cash deduction. Managed to get $300 off to $4299. The take in price for the TV is $550, so you can opt for this to save some $$. If you sell off the free TV, soundbar and wall mount, should be able to recoup about $800. That makes the TV @ $3500.

PC Show (Courts Booth) Price: $4599 Free 48"" TV, Samsung sound bar, Samsung wireless keyboard, slim wall mount, $100 grocery vouchers, xBox (Not sure which model).

As you can probably see, CEE didn't give xBox. Not that I mind though. I just want cash deduction. Managed to get $300 off to $4299. The take in price for the TV is $550, so you can opt for this to save some $$. If you sell off the free TV, soundbar and wall mount, should be able to recoup about $800. That makes the TV @ $3500. Pretty damn good deal. I went cee during lunch just now.

I think this is mainly for the things you are lazy or too busy to do. The energy monitoring is good to have and also good for things you can control while away from home. In my case, besides the energy thingy, i have my fan away from my bed and most of the time i sleep i don't turn it on until i need to but then i'm damm super lazy and tired to walk out of my bed to do it lol so controlling it from my phone is very convenient. @keenklee Ya, you need to know what you want to control.

The only usefull on w215 is the energy monitoring info and temperature of socket plug.   Timer on/off and gui interface needs rework.

Each time the circuit trips the analog timers go off by the time the circuit is down. The smart plug is smarter and better.

So I wrote to them and their reply was ""if you purchased the product from our official website or any authorized seller, then walk in to the service center with the invoice in order to get the battery else kindly coordinate with your point of purchase for better assistance.

The folks there tell me something like .... they don't sell the battery over the counter,  they only will sell the battery if the smartphone was sent in for service.  They ask me to purchase online from places like Qoo10, etc. To me, poor customer service. Donkey years ago,  when I visited TP-Link service centre, they exchange faulty TP-Link AV500.

The singtel pricing is for re-contract and existing customer. For new customer it is  $59.90 As for free x months subscriptions it is applicable to others too. And the price may not include TV subscription and others charges. Fibre charges will depend on each contract and promotion.

As some did complained having to pay $200+ for end of contract termination which is not mentioned clearly in the sign-up. Agreed. TS is very BIASED in the report. I have used Singtel and M1 simultaneously. M1 firstly has awful phone pricing when buying with contract. Sometimes even $50 more expensive than other other telcos. Then when it comes to phone trade-ins, the price of the phone a lot lower than what other telcos also offer. So in the end, you end up paying $100 more than with other telcos. I ended up changing my second line back to Singtel afterwards. Best trade-in prices most of the time and the price for when you use services like Samsung Concierge, you can see the amount they'll pay for when you want to re-contract every year means you won't even have to pay the penalty for early recontract at all. So just concentrate on paying for the phone itself. No experience with Starhub anymore. So I won't comment on them. So telco's very simplistic mindset without even taking into account of future upgrades and recontracts makes me say he is way too biased. Some more, first post only. Cannot even trust at all. As for FIBRE, never ever take Starhub as they do not care about gamers. Their DNS routing is so bad that while players on Singtel, ViewQwest and MyRepublic are on 50-59ms, Starhub players were getting 130+ms ping on Blizzard servers. So we should treat Starhub the same way they treat their customers. Avoid completely."

Amazon is worth it due to price change and free shipping for some items. Some new release items like 1080ti are being sold by scalpers at US$200 mark up. So it's cheaper to buy locally. I have bought a lot of items from Amazon and some items are worth it even if you RMA once. But twice would not have been worth it, e.g. I recently RMA Corsair H75, shipping was about $40. Pros is I can do this on a weekend and they mail back to my doorstep. Cons is if I send it in one more time, it would have been more expensive than local. Other things to consider is a transformer due to the difference in voltage. A good one doesn't come cheap as well. So for anyone buying computer stuff, do take note, sharing my experience here. For other household items like kitchen stuff like Joseph and Simple Human, it's cheaper there and lower risk of failure compared to electronics."

For me, feels like wasting a day of leave just for RMA. Lost opportunity cost. In a year, you might just need that one extra day to take care of your kids, parents. Unless you stay close to distro, if not you will waste the other half wandering around or ended up going back to work early. True story that happened to my friend. Lol."

I visited the booth, I asked for the laptop and a sale personnel presented to me a $399 forth generation i5 HP Windows 7 laptop with 1 year OEM warranty which they did not have sample of because he said its limited stock daily in the show. I decided to buy it though. When I was about to make the payment, a staff behind the counter told me this is the last one for the day and the package was opened only for the purpose of the customer to take a look at the color and he promised its a brand new unit. As I was in a rush, I just made a minor inspection for any visible damages then I bought it. Then later I tried to mess with the newly bought laptop. I saw plenty of chinese characters in an english environment setup. To my surprised its an i5 but M520 chipset, a first generation i series not the forth as promised! I realize it was running on Windows 7 Ultimate version! Its only then I realize something was seriously wrong because its not possible that OEM will include the Ultimate license for that laptop's configuration, its simply under power. So I look around the laptop for the Windows license sticker which must be visible usually at the bottom of the unit. Not to my surpised, its nowhere to be found. Its not a genuine Windows 7. The worse part is yet to be over. When I took a closer look at the HP logo under the display, I realize the printing looks uneven! Then I close up the lip, guess what? The circular HP logo which was unique to pavilion series fell off from its sticky tape! My closer inspection concluded that it was not an authentic HP product as the plastic feels cheap and none of those HP labels could found on the unit. You can imagine how I felt, so I went right back to the show and ask for refund. They agreed to refund me like immediately. They are basically telling me they know they're selling counterfeit HP product by doing so. I checked, the company of that booth is Atrix Dynamics Pte Ltd, the main store is located at Sim Lim Square level 6.

If the explanation is genuine, this shows their whole business system is flawed and broken. This is rather worrying. All of us know the consequences of selling fakes in Singapore. A lot of such companies are in to make a quick bucks and experience tells us that most shops in SLS are not trust-worthy and I personally believe they still don't (especially shops/businesses still under the same bosses). Some shops just changed their names and continue to operate. The authorities should really be doing their job in clamping down such businesses in SLS so that those genuine and honest shops (yes there are, I have been visiting them for decades) are able to have better businesses without these black sheep."

MADE IN CHINA can also mean the fabrication process, like after designing and trying out the circuit on a breadboard or wire wrap. business will look for company that does the etching and after process of the pcb. we're talking about manufacturing easily 10000 pieces of pcb here not what you do in you bedroom. which country will you will go to for the price?? and thats not rocket science either. and for your info, CHINA do manufacture rockets. and they're really good in it. remember, CHINA people are very smart its just that lots of company form by them simply do not have integrity or they're being suppress for the reasons of cost for doing the right thing.

Honestly look like u are having a low end ASUS notebook. Most consumers will go for mid range or high end notebook that provide at least 2 yrs warranty and has AC wifi. Many also go for Extended Warranty. I was using ASUS G750JX before moving to HP 15-bc010Tx. I sold my ASUS after 3 yrs. Now my HP notebook has 2+2 yrs local onsite extended warranty. You can always buy EW and usb wifi adaptor for AC wifi.

If you have the invoice, just go and claim the warranty with your invoice. They recognize invoice only. Registration online does not mean anything. One can buy in Jan, then register in 5 months later in June. Thus online registration by most brands does not count. The warranty date now follows your manufacture date, which is 1 month earlier than your purchase. When you send down the first time for servicing, you probably did not bring in your invoice, thus they are unable to update the system. This is rather standard warranty policy across most brands."

Please Do not top up as many r selling it at $70-$80 brand new. Basically u r still buying the Pokemon 2ds xl set for 24 x $10 = 240 + router reselling price $60 = $300. If u buy a Pokemon 2ds xl and the 2 other games separately.  I think is slightly more than $300.

It's the charge by NetLink Trust, not M1. But then, since you're on SingNet ADSL, you can opt for the 1Gbps @ $34/mth (12 months $29 + 12 months $39). Inclusive of the router, which is what the 500Mbps + router costs. Still need to pay the registration fee of $48.15, but you technically get free speed boost. Or just pay $31/mth inclusive of router for 300Mbps Fibre on the same promotion. Maybe you can ask them for the 500Mbps upgrade but I'm not sure if allowed or not. https://www.m1.com.sg/personal/bundles%20and%20promotions/highlights/fbb-switch The reason why I'm including router costs is because SingNet routers are not compatible with other ISPs at all, plus ADSL routers use such old tech that you can't even get speeds close too.

This one never mention whether it is for mobile or broadband or don't know what.. better to look at your Contracts properly.  If there is a charge for downgrade,  it should be clearly stated.. if there is no charge for upgrade,  it should also be clearly stated in the Contracts;  otherwise,  take them to task.  They cannot just say downgrade got charge and upgrade no charge and explain to you that there is a change of billing plan because upgrade also is also involved a change in billing plan.. all must in black and white.   However,  if they have told you that they needed to charge when you recontract and you never object,  then very hard to argue back."

Hi ! There is a way around this.  The SIM card is a post-paid card.  Which means that you are entitled to a free replacement in a calendar year if you lose your SIM.  So you just report lost and get a new one.  They will issue you with the 3-in-1 card at no charge.  I guess you want to use a new phone with Nano slot, right ?"

You should have the countless receipts and T&C papers that you receive with this as well. As you can see, I will clearly be paying $44.90 per month by doing so and this is the proof.

Just so you know, it clearly states that Singtel does throttle Torrent and Peer-2-Peer connection and you will be paying more than what even ViewQwest is offering so.... No thanks."

But our discussion is just academic if it is not for sale. Yup, we will know the true specs when the monitor is officially released. Not to say that you are wrong, but I stand by my understanding that the S2718H/S2718HX monitor is physically a Full HD monitor that somehow accepts a UHD input (4K) through a HDMI 2.0 cable. I do hope that I am wrong, because that would be a really cheap price for a 4K monitor. The reason why I say that it's a Full HD monitor is simple. 1. Price - My current LG 27UD88 4K monitor costs $865. The similarly specced 27"" Dell IPS 4K monitor also cost around $849. Therefore, this led to my doubt about the $359 S2718H monitor being a full 4K monitor. 2. The manual listed that the Pixel Per Inch (PPI) of the S2718H monitor is 81. A true 27"" 4K monitor would have PPI of 163, whereas a true 27"" Full HD monitor would have a PPI of 81. This would suggest that the S2718H is physically a Full HD monitor. 3. The monitor would accept a 4K input only under special circumstances, that is OSD Movie HDR or Game HDR. To be honest, I have no idea what is Movie HDR or Game HDR, but under normal windows settings, the maximum resolution is 1920 x 1080 as listed in the manual. TL;DR Price is too low, PPI is too low to be a real 4K monitor. Of course, I hope to be proven wrong. This is all my humble opinions. My advise is to wait for the monitor to come out before deciding to drop the money on it. There are also a few threads on other forums debating about this, like here and here , if anyone is interested."

I don't really like the colour of these modes, prefer to calibrate it myself, the default setting seems way too reddish 4k mainly is the resolution.. HDR is about contrast.. full 4k experience is if you combine contrast, chroma, resolution and frequency.. the more you achieve the qualities of the hdmi 2.0 standard, the better you achieve those requirement.. In our case, our Dell monitor has HDR.. As to why it supports HDR is to compensate on the lacking elements like nits and the bits.. this is to experience 4k with such a cheap price.. in my reading, 3 requirement is needed to combine in order to achieve this.. the content (game or video) needs to support.. the graphics card.. and the monitor.. our monitor has 2 hdr modes. Movie and game.. you need to select either of the 2.. after the windows creator update, if you toggle this, there seems to be an issue.. if you google this, it has something to do with gpu driver support.."

The rest is marketing. This is somewhat true. To be able to achieve HDR, the cable that you have matters. The one that has 18Gbps bandwidth will have the label; Certified Premium. That is when the cable is fully capable of transferring 18 Gbps. Here is the current scenario that I faced. Basically with my previous Certified Premium cable, I was able to activate HDR on the port (LG based UHDTV) which is then connected to my PC. Games like Mass Effect Andromeda works perfectly. But recently, due to my wallmounting, I needed a longer cable to reach my PC. So I bought another Certified Premium cable of the same brand. Due to it being bent a lot cos of the wall mount and having to go through the hole, the cable was not able to carry the full 18 Gbps bandwidth and that in itself has affected the HDR functionality even when it is not even turned on. Basically, my TV will flicker like crazy showing black screen and back to the screen and then black screen again even when I'm not watching any HDR content but am outputting at 4K. I had to lower the 4K display output to just 30Hz and not even 50Hz in order to not get the flicker. Today, my Port Saver came. So I was able to use the port saver to do the bend while my HDMI cable is not being bent as much. This resulted in a much more stable 4K 60Hz with Deep Colour enabled which is LG's term for allowing HDR content to be received on the port. Don't even try to use a HDMI 'High Speed' cable. Their bandwidth will not be stable enough to carry 4K 60Hz even. That is without even including HDR in the mix. Hope that helps. Anyway, not long, HDMI 2.1 ports will be available on new TVs and Graphic Cards and consoles and even new players. (Yes. You'll need new players and all for HDMI 2.1) With HDMI 2.1, the difference with HDMI 2.0 is so huge that it will be able to carry the full Chroma 4:4:4. That is why you see a sudden drought of 4K blu rays and even the upcoming monitors being delayed. As all are waiting for the HDMI 2.1 standard. Meaning again, new cables. But because of the ridiculously high bandwidth, I believe even with the cable bent, it should be able to carry the full bandwidth output. So look out for that!"

Looking at the ad, the promotion runs past Comex, hence I am assuming that there should be another outlet /location for redemption. With regards to your second question regarding purchasing from an authorised retailer and heading to Comex for redemption - it is best to double check with the sales staff of the authorised retailer at the outlet you are purchasing for more details.  For all we know, it could just be a tie up for Comex and for purchases at Comex. As of this time, I am unable to find any info regarding this as well.

Updating of SG/M'sia map is no problem. Got free update through mfm. Recently I tried using Andriod app OsmAnd as GPS for driving in Austria. It's quite good. It's free and comes with 9 map downloads (if you pay for it you will get unlimited downloads/updates, quite cheap too). If you don't mind using phone as GPS this one is good to try. Else get Garmin. My problem with Garmin is it is quite troublesome to get free updated maps when I want to use it in overseas, Malaysia and SG no problem though.

Hard to please everyone, Shopee and Q10 both direct u back to seller to settle dispute, while Lazada will be the middleman to deal with return. Both will have both form of troubles, but just do more research and review to understand. Rule of thumb when shopping online, ensure seller has a physical shop or Warehouse to go to flip table in case got dispute. Nv purchase from seller without knowing who is behind the eshop.

I bought a Red Bean i-flame tv box last night at the Comex 2017.  They were marketing on 2 of such products: i-flame n the other i-mini or somthing.  Claiming that i-flame is a newer model (2017) with better specs n nothing much were said about the i-mini (2016). The original price is varies from $359 to $259 and shop currently selling at $179.  As usual, the drama marketing scheme started selling at $159 for limited pcs n eventually dropped to $99. The board stated 3yrs warranty but the receipt only mentioned 1 yr warranty. When I clarified later, the seller explained that 3yrs warranty for software n 1 yr warranty is meant for the hardware. I tried connecting n setting it up last night but gave up eventually as it was so slow n lagging. Not giving up, I tried again this morning.  The streaming is extremely slow.  I thought it was my wifi reception is my room so I moved the set to the living, set it up right beside my router.  Now, I've dual band 1Gbps router n the i-flame can only detect 2.4Ghz bandwidth. The streaming still very slow n i decided to install n try out the speed test. The results was disappointing. I tried connecting varies wifi i.e. my router, my portable wifi router with 4G SIM n wifi hotspot from my mobiles.  The speed ranged from 1mbps to 10mbps only.  If you connect to LAN, the speed is still acceptable. So if you intend to connect via LAN, the product is ok. If wifi, you can forget about it.  Next I noticed, the box stated 8GB memory but the internal memory is only 2GB + internal SD storage 4GB. I went down to the shop at AMK Hub only to realise that several buyer were also complaining about the streaming speed. Then I noticed that they are selling at $100 n said its a low end model. I requested to exchange for other products for the amount I paid but was rejected. I proceed down to Comex again to demand for a refund. They just refund quietly. Oh boy, I looked at the number of people queuing for the product, a lot of people will definitely be very disappointed."

I used to buy cheap Lenovo Android phone for less than $100 at such event @Expo and later found out few default apps are malware when using company enterprise malware tool to scan it. They will still be there even with factory reset due to default apps. Imagine having these potentially malicious boxes connected to your home wifi which can reach the rest of your home gadgets and probably detecting all your home wifi activities. Better to get from reputable brand AND seller if really need to have one. My 2 cents.

Claiming that i-flame is a newer model (2017) with better specs n nothing much were said about the i-mini (2016). The original price is varies from $359 to $259 and shop currently selling at $179. As usual, the drama marketing scheme started selling at $159 for limited pcs n eventually dropped to $99. The board stated 3yrs warranty but the receipt only mentioned 1 yr warranty. When I clarified later, the seller explained that 3yrs warranty for software n 1 yr warranty is meant for the hardware. I tried connecting n setting it up last night but gave up eventually as it was so slow n lagging. Not giving up, I tried again this morning. The streaming is extremely slow. I thought it was my wifi reception is my room so I moved the set to the living, set it up right beside my router. Now, I've dual band 1Gbps router n the i-flame can only detect 2.4Ghz bandwidth. The streaming still very slow n i decided to install n try out the speed test. The results was disappointing. I tried connecting varies wifi i.e. my router, my portable wifi router with 4G SIM n wifi hotspot from my mobiles. The speed ranged from 1mbps to 10mbps only. If you connect to LAN, the speed is still acceptable. So if you intend to connect via LAN, the product is ok. If wifi, you can forget about it. Next I noticed, the box stated 8GB memory but the internal memory is only 2GB + internal SD storage 4GB. I went down to the shop at AMK Hub only to realise that several buyer were also complaining about the streaming speed. Then I noticed that they are selling at $100 n said its a low end model. I requested to exchange for other products for the amount I paid but was rejected. I proceed down to Comex again to demand for a refund. They just refund quietly. Oh boy, I looked at the number of people queuing for the product, a lot of people will definitely be very disappointed. Stick with UBOX and evpad. The other TV box will say this and that, at the end of the day, it is a clone and the apps don't work after a few months. ""Their servers"" will mysterious vanish after the box is sold and the company can disappear before the warranty."

How you like to interpret is, again, entirely up to you. ""The World Health Organization and the International Agency for Research on Cancer have classified mobile phones as a \x93possible carcinogen,\x94 which means there\x92s currently not enough research to say whether either causes cancer. Earlier this year, a rodent study found heavy exposures to cell phone radiation increased rats\x92 risks for some brain and heart tumors. More rodent research has tied high levels of Wi-Fi and cell exposure to hormonal shifts and oxidative stress\x97the kind of shifts that could promote cancer or brain diseases. But many of these animal studies are \x93all over the place\x94 in terms of their design quality, Foster says. Animal research often does not translate to humans. Also, many of the most worrying experiments involved rodents that had been exposed to levels of radiation far greater than what people encounter when using mobile phones or wireless networks.""

""The World Health Organization and the International Agency for Research on Cancer have classified mobile phones as a \x93possible carcinogen,\x94 which means there\x92s currently not enough research to say whether either causes cancer. Earlier this year, a rodent study found heavy exposures to cell phone radiation increased rats\x92 risks for some brain and heart tumors. More rodent research has tied high levels of Wi-Fi and cell exposure to hormonal shifts and oxidative stress\x97the kind of shifts that could promote cancer or brain diseases. But many of these animal studies are \x93all over the place\x94 in terms of their design quality, Foster says. Animal research often does not translate to humans. Also, many of the most worrying experiments involved rodents that had been exposed to levels of radiation far greater than what people encounter when using mobile phones or wireless networks.""

I agree that for homeplug, TP-Link is quite impressive. I am also using TL-WPA8730 for many months. Before that, I was using Aztech 500Mbps, but it only give me 80Mbps, which I accepted it as a way of life due to my old condo wiring. Then last year, I tested the TP-Link TL-WPA8730, which achieved about 200Mbps when plugged directly to wall socket (even though the app claims I get full 1200Mbps throughput). Unfortunately, my study room no space to plug the homeplug directly, so I had to plug to extension cord, and I ended up getting 120Mbps, which is not too bad (the app shows throughput drops to 230Mbps). Good thing is that this model also has a wireless extender which I also utilise. Recently, I received a review unit from D-Link DAP-1720. After 2 weeks of testing, I am pleased with the performance. This extender comes with LAN port so I plugged the desktop directly to DAP-1720 instead of WPA8730 and I attained above 300Mbps. Very happy. In addition, I felt that the DAP-1720 extender works better than the WPA8730 extender, in terms of speed as well as coverage. So end of the day, it depends on your house layout. Homeplug has an uncertainty that the existing wires are not optimised, and requires direct wall socket, whereas wireless extender is more flexible, easier to deploy.

The store is actually called X-Kimi (6485). Modern tech is selling TV boxes and uninvolved in the deal. I did get a due refund in the end though fake MI most likely still being sold. For latest update, please read my post on page 4 or click this link . I was at IT Show earlier (18 Mar, Sat) and became an unsuspecting victim of a counterfeit Mi Power Bank scam. I was unaware before this incident that there were so many shady deals happening at these events. The store in question is called Modern Tech (Booth 6347) X-Kimi (6485), situated at level 6, right across the Seagate booth. The salesmen looked like a bunch of Singaporean guys and they were selling mi powerbank 10400mah at $15 among other miscellaneous products like wireless keyboards, mouse and the like. Frontal photo of booth (taken on 19 Mar, Sunday) As the owner of an authentic mi powerbank (that I received as a gift), I thought $15 was a pretty good deal since the retail price of a regular mi 10400mah powerbank was $26. Along with a middle-aged lady and some Bangladesh workers, I bought myself one silver powerbank. If I remembered correctly, the sign above the powerbanks even said 'Genuine Mi Powerbanks', I should have known better, sigh. After buying the product, back at home, I began to test it out. The first thing I realised is the usb cable provided cannot even fit into the port. None of my own personal cables fit into the powerbank as well. The charger simply put, did not work. This got me suspicious and I took out my old powerbank to compare with the one I just bought. A quick search online also showed me how to identify a fake powerbank ( x ). As I guessed, I had been duped, the powerbank is a fake product. These are the results of my findings. All of the pictures here belong to me. And apparently, these same sellers are scamming people on Lazada as well. I reported this matter to the IT Show Organisers on Facebook though it looks like nothing can be done till the show is over. Once they reply, I will update this thread accordingly. A google search online also showed me this was not the first time that this had happened. http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/si...s-4892255.html http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/co...k-5162882.html http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/ce...h-5065123.html https://www.allsingaporestuff.com/ar...-illegal-spore Quite honestly, I am to blame too for being greedy and uninformed. I will go back to the booth tomorrow and try asking for a refund, but otherwise, I will take this $15 as a lesson learned. However, even with that said, just because incidents like this had happened so frequently, I do not think the IT fair and other such events should condone such behaviour. Doing so only ruins the experience for everyone who is there to have a good time. I also feel bad for those Bangladesh workers who were there before me. It pains me to think about how many hours they have to work to gain back the same sum of money. TLDR; Everyone please be vigilant before buying anything at the IT Fair and other subsequent shows. If the deal seems too good to be true, exercise caution before forking out your money. Also, just avoid Modern Tech X-Kimi (6485) at all costs."

But before coming up to the convention centre, I made a stop at the MI Shop at level 2 first. Salesperson there confirmed item is fake but said nothing much can be done on their part as this problem had been persisting for a long time. They told me I could try emailing their customer service but legal action is unlikely and even if there is, it's going to be a long arduous process. I went to level 6 to take pictures to verify where I made the purchase. Sellers still selling xiaomi powerbanks, this time at $16. Perhaps their sales were too good, the amount of powerbanks they have was nearly halved of what I saw yesterday. I went to the IT Show organisers' office on level 4 and this time they took action. They verified where I made the purchase from and realise that the store is actually called X-kimi. My deepest apologies to Modern tech, that are simply selling 3rd party android TV boxes. The it show  representative contacted the boss of x-kimi and we went back to the booth upstairs. I was introduced to the boss of x-kimi that as it turned out was a prc. Once we reached the store, I realised they are selling the powerbanks at $15 again.  He claimed that their MI powerbanks are imported and authentic but fakes might have been mixed into his stocks. I showed him the proof of his products being fake, he said it was just a one time mistake. The shop refunded me the $15 and they sent me on my way. I got my money back but sellers are still selling these powerbanks when I was leaving. So to all remaining it show goers, please take note.

Second, is the hassle free updates, saving me valuable time and electrical energy consumption. Third, is cheaper because Android is a free operating system, with lots of supported apps which are freely available on Google Play Store. Also smaller footprint & using much lesser system resources, less heat dissipation. Buy Minix from local distributor has got 3 years warranty (one to one exchange)."

Sales people tend to tell you whatever you want to hear in order to get you to seal the deal. As much as they promise you this and that, there is no such thing as guaranteed 100% uptime on 100% of channels when it comes to android iptv streaming. Only traffic lights cable operators can guarantee you that. The beauty of android is its open source so even if certain apps are down, you can always look for and install other similar apps. So dont let some imbecile tell you that tv boxes just stop working after 3-6 months.

Only when i wanted to purchase an item and was told it had to pay the subscription as member first via online. Thereafter then they could sell the item to me which i decided no go. Hence just one quick look into that thread confirmed it was that shop selling and doing advertisement. But that advert on Android TV box is not part of the sales at that time. Regards.

They will do it since there are so many eyes watching. If you dun do it today, then your box will become another paperweight."

They all run a tablet version of Android and come with no DRM support so no hd netflix etc. The preinstalled streaming apps are not legally sourced and when they eventually get taken down you won't be able to use them anymore. Since you already own the box you could probably open Google play and install the streaming apps yourself . If Google play is not installed you can sideload the apk yourself. There are only 2 official android tv boxes. They are the Nvidia shield and the Xiaomi mi box. Those runs the official Google tv version which come with DRM support for netflix 4k and YouTube 4k and Chromecast support."

For 720p, all you need is widevine lvl 1. For 1080p/4k, you need widevine lvl 1 + official netflix certification on the device. Nowadays many newer tv box models already come with widevine lvl 1 so watching netflix in 720p is possible. 2. Then again, do people who buy tv boxes actually even use it for netflix? You know i know everybody knows whats the main reason more and more people are stopping their cable subscriptions and turning to tv boxes. Lets just leave it at that. Are tv boxes a gimmick? I dont know. Maybe as much a gimmick as smartphones and tablets are then since they do function the same in most ways. As long a tv box serves the purpose i bought it for, then i guess i am happy with it. 3. All the google framework, services and playstore do not just disappear when you factory resetted a box. The previous guy must have did something more than just plainly resetting the box or its some dodgy 3rd party appstore that was installed and not the official google playstore he was talking about."

I considered chromecast, but the fact that I need to first get on a mobile or laptop and then cast it, is a put off, I would rather use a remote.

Can be 1 or 2 months between printing. For my printing cycle,  the printhead gets clogged easily. Repeated cleaning will unclog the printhead. However, within the warranty,  the printhead got clogged so badly that cleaning doesn't help.  It was changed under warranty. IMHO,  likely it could be the ink technology used for my model.  Not sure if there are any change to the L360. To prevent clogging,  use it every 1 or 2 weeks.   It's a hassle. The plus points -  the ink last a long time. I am waiting for the ink to run out and try Canon. I have very good experience with Canon non-ink tank model.  Use once every six months also not an issue.   The rare occurrence of clogging,  cleaning will eliminate it. I usually don't go for Epson and HP.  But no choice for the L350,  the only one in the market at that time. HTH. P.S.  Here's a tip - The fastest way to use the printer is the copy function.  On printer, load paper and ""Copy' a few pieces. Tip #2 -  To eliminate paper jam,  use 80gsm and load what is necessary.  When the pack is opened, keep in ziplock bag."

But the colours on the screen will not be as good as other TN panels so be forewarned. You can off set that with a $300 monitor if you want. If you don't like Dell, there are other brands like Aftershock who also sport a 1050ti on their notebooks. Just look for anything that has a 1050ti in it if you want to stay below the 2k range and your son will be fine. You'll have to spend slightly more than 2k for a 1060, but you'll futureproof it to an extent. A 1050ti is equivalent to a 970m in terms of performance and pascal cards like the 1060 outstrip the previous generation by almost 40%."

The pricing from the last fair was as follows; http://www.hardwarezone.com.sg/itsho...chures/d-link/ The two new models launched since, the DCS 936L and 2530L, have yet to release their pricing for the fair. That said, I can help you with the following DCS 2630L - Wifi AC - 1080P - 180deg view angle DCS   960L - Wifi AC -  760P -  180deg view angle DCS   935L - Wifi AC -  760P - (H) 78.44\xb0 (V) 47.90\xb0 (D) 85.98\xb0 DCS   936L - Wifi N - (H) 100\xb0 (V) 54\xb0 (D) 120\xb0 DCS 2530L - Wifi N - 1080P - 180deg view angle, (Max 15fps) I cut and pasted from sites, and reflects my experience. To me the above is the post impt factors for the cameras, while balancing price. For me, especially for WIFI based cameras, was.... a. Do I want Wireless N or Wireless AC Its not a question of which is better or which is technically a necessity. For me, it was simply, there was too much congestion on the 2.4Ghz band in my area for me to want to try. So I chose Wifi AC. b. Resolution I knew, the bare minimum was 720P for me. A lot brands still offer 640P, claiming that it is sufficient for home use. I do partially agree. But what I did was google comparison videos and pictures of 1080P vs 720P vs 640P, and decide from there, Of course, price taken into consideration. c. Viewing Angle This should be something to consider when buying the camera. Basically the wider the angles the more you see. Some manufacturers will say, use a PTZ design. This is fine, but trust me, if you access your cameras often enough, moving the darn thing around is more like a good idea in theory than in reality, especially if you do it all the time. Finally, you should give some thought to a. How do you want to record? To SD card, to cloud, to NAS, to stand alone PC. All have their pros and cons. Cost in increasing order. b. How often will you be accessing recording? Once again, the listing in pt a, but in the reverse order.Stand alone PC easiest IMHO, NAS etc etc etc b. The more resolution you have, the more fps you have, the bigger your files will be. The bigger your files are, the shorter you can record on SD cards. etc etc etc. So its a case of plan what you want to achieve and how.... then list your camera models. Doesn't mean buy more expensive is better. Because to maximize it, you will have to outlay more. FYI, I use 6 cameras currently; 5 Dlinks, of which one is LAN Cable. Like you, I went with DLink at that time, because I wanted to be sure it would integrate easily with my router, DIR 868L. Last advise I can give you is, LAN cable connections is better than Wifi. And yes, DLink is a ""pricier"" brand for cameras.... Hope this helps."

I suggest you first, get and install 1x DCS-930L and move from there. I started like that and at the current moment, I have 4 active DCS-930L and recently, finally added recording using DNR-202L.  They are running 15fps using LAN cable.  I don't use Wifi because of electromagnetic radiation and speed issues at furthest location. I have another 2 or 3 sets for spares and estimate that I would probably end up installing another 4 more active. Along the way,  2 or 3 DCS-930L conked off excluding 1x DCS-932L (IR) that has overheating issue. For active monitor i.e. periodic login and view,  I would say the more cameras, the better. P.S.   and they work with Singtel provided router."

But still struggling whether to get DCS-2630L or DCS-960L as the difference is $100 and one with full HD and one with 720p (just with mic)... $100 more for 1080p (not really necessary) and built-in speaker (this may serve me more in future)... sigh... money very good to earn for them"

After some thoughts, I think I will get their IP Camera - more purposeful to monitor my house when I'm overseas. But still struggling whether to get DCS-2630L or DCS-960L as the difference is $100 and one with full HD and one with 720p (just with mic)... $100 more for 1080p (not really necessary) and built-in speaker (this may serve me more in future)... sigh... money very good to earn for them Here are other ways to look at it. If because of bandwidth limitation that you can view 1080p @ 15fps,  the same bandwidth limitation will allow you to get 720p @ 30fps. OR If in the future you decide to do 24 hours recording,  where 1080p@30fps allows you to record for, let's say, 10 days, with 720p@30fps, you can record twice as long at maybe 20+ days."

Don't misunderstand me, I am using the DIR 868L because it came free. It as not perfect but I got around the issues well enough to actually run one router and one AP for the cameras.

If you want fast wifi network speed connect the NAS directly to main router. Do not use any wireline or wifi to connect the NAS. For faster transfer between NAS to PC both need to be as close as possible network wise. I would recommend to go for a NAS which allows you to upgrade RAM and maybe offer a free ram upgrade on NAS purchase. Asustor AS3102T looks pretty good although ram is not upgradable. But has a pretty good processor and 4k video play support. Qnap 251+ although expensive offer ram upgrade and plex capable processor Synology options for intel processors and same specs seem to be bit more expensive as nothing in the price even offers 2gb ram with an intel processor.For example DS216+II offers only 1 GB ram. I have 16gb installed on my NAS. Overkill maybe but I find it to be a very good performance boost."

It was around $15XX for the i7 Specs. IMO it's better option than UX331 (which you can get for $17XX) because of the price difference for the same spec + you get a bigger screen for the UX420UN. Just ask promoter about not getting freebies (even though its included anyway) and payment by cash (even though some promoters don't care about cash v non-cash payments). Somehow the price will drop.

But if you expect snappy performance, no it will not deliver. It's a nicely built notebook, nice price too. But the keyboard is crappy in my opinion. So it doesn't really get you a good experience to begin with other than killer looks and super lightweight. If you plan to use it more like a tablet, then it's not too bad. But at that juncture, you might as well consider the Samsung TabPro S clearing for S$799. Specs can't compete, but it's great for just tablet-like usage with Windows advantage. something wrote: is m5 good for light photoshop job?... saw one yoga 900s 12.5"" QHD IPS display selling at $1199."

A Surface is limited to only 1 USB port, hence it is an issue when you are req to use a mouse ,a keyboard and a flash drive for instance - That would require a USB hub (possibly powered) Pretty similar to the Tab S in this regard as well. Laptop is generally fully fledged and have higher storage, and in some sense better repair ability and upgradability dora1905 wrote: hi,  may I ask what is the difference between the laptop and surface pro and  tab S pro.

Btw...will we need to set password for the repeater or extender? I m new to this...m hoping that my phone or tablet can auto detect the strongest signal wherever u r in the house They are technically the same but marketed in a different name. Extender sounds nicer, but they basically re-broadcast the signal, hence ""repeater"". If you buy the repeater with WPS button, then you can press on both the router and the repeater to sync the SSID. Once done, then your wireless extender is ready to work. But I do not like this method as it may not achieve optimal connectivity. Alternatively smartphone app to walk through the steps to set up easily. Brands like D-Link have apps to let you configure through step by step, allow you to set different SSID and password. Some tips to ensure your wireless extender achieves fast speed: 1. Your wireless router must already be of high spec. Typically, wireless extender will drop the speed by half. 2. Connect the extender to 5GHz frequency to attain higher speed. 3. Place the extender in a good location where it can receive good signal from the router, e.g. place it in the first or second room from the living room where the router is located. 4. Extender must be relatively high spec, e.g. AC1200 and above. I currently use D-Link DAP-1720 as a extender to D-Link DIR-895L. Works very well, it also comes with LAN port which I connect to my desktop in my study room. Before that, I was using homeplugs. I started off with Aztech 500Mbps, but it only give me 80Mbps, which I accepted it as a way of life due to my old condo wiring. Then last year, I tested the TP-Link TL-WPA8730 , which I tested and achieved about 200Mbps when plugged directly to wall socket (even though the app claims I get full 1200Mbps throughput). Unfortunately, my study room no space to plug the homeplug directly, so I had to plug to extension cord, and I ended up getting 120Mbps, which is not too bad (the app shows throughput drops to 230Mbps). Now that I have DAP-1720, I plugged the desktop directly to the LAN port and I attained above 300Mbps. Very happy. I felt that the DAP-1720 extender works better than the WPA8730 extender, in terms of speed as well as signal strength.

You need to check for Service Tag number behind your monitor. As per norm, you will need to submit your name, address, contact no, etc. 2) The warranty registration CAN be completed. However, for some reason, it WON'T be recognised by Dell. (wonder where all my info has gone) 3) After more than 48h (the time for Dell to reflect your product registration), you can check your Warranty Status online. You need to input the Service Tag to check. 4) You will realise that no matter how many times you key in the Service Tag, your warranty status cannot be found. 5) I then call up Dell at 1800 3947486. Dell does not seem to have email support. You have to call them. I cannot find anywhere email address on their website. 6) Now, this part is very important. Beside your receipt or invoice, you NEED to keep the box (I hope you have not thrown them away). 7) Dell will not recognise your warranty based on retailer's receipt alone. You must present them the box which must show Order Number starting with 9xxxxx. 8) If you throw the box away and only keep the receipt, Dell may compromise and give you standard warranty of 3 yrs. However, the 3 yrs warranty will not be from your date of purchase, but from the date of Product Manufacture Date! So, if you bought a monitor that is manufactured 2 years ago, you only have 1 year warranty left. This is only for monitors. Laptop wise, I have no idea. The above are my personal experience and hope it clarifies the warranty registration process and what you need to keep."

I had previously purchased 2 x 24 inch Dell LCD monitors, with an extended 5 year warranty. When they were delivered, the invoice was noted as 3 years warranty. I called/emailed to inform them of the mistake, and they later issued another invoice with the correct warranty information. In the 4th year, the built-in SD card reader didn't work anymore, and I made a warranty claim. Dell claimed that the warranty was only 3 years, so would not be doing any warranty exchange. They kept on using the old (and wrong) 3 year warranty invoice to support their claim. I sent them a copy of my 5 year warranty invoice. They exchanged the faulty LCD monitor. So just keep whatever invoice they send along with your purchased item. Obviously check that the invoice has all details and specifications correctly noted."

I bought from Courts at the PC show at MBS. All I got was a receipt, no invoice. The Dell CSO only recognise the Order Number and nothing else. My monitor had a 5yr warranty too, but the CSO keep insisting on 3yr. Haha. Luckily, I still kept the box which had the words ""5 yr Warr"" printed on a small sticker. In the end, I got the Order Number they wanted, and was given 5yr warranty. Got to say, Dell should really print the words ""keep the box"" big big, so customers will be aware of it. I wonder how many people actually keep the box after purchases. The box is not small either, so space consuming! And I have to keep it for the next 5 yrs."

How is the posts linking to awaiting enlistment? I don't see any linkage at all. Care to enlighten? It's not being defensive, it's just being objective. If you want to say M1 outages, list out the outages on SingNet too. I can assure you, from Jan 2015 till date, SingNet suffered the same duration or longer downtime than M1. Even before that, the outages on M1 Fibre since debut in Sept 2010 is also few and far between, unlike their problematic mobile network from 2010 to 2014."

Posted with Samsung Galaxy S7 edge HardwareZone Forums app Like you said, raw speed isn't so important. What you didn't say is, latency and packet loss are more important. https://www.imda.gov.sg/applications/rbs/chart.html See the latency and packet loss section, it's typically both around the same, or M1 is lower (aka better). What this aspect shows actually? M1 don't focus so much on raw speed, but focus on what matters most, the real world loading performance. You don't operate the servers, and therefore the need for fastest upload/download is just good to see. Download big files from faraway overseas servers? Still bound to their allocated bandwidth per customer, and most don't give speeds >100Mbps anyway. Most super speed download/upload servers are local/regional CDNs, and therefore speed is more important. In that sense, M1's broadband isn't so far off from SingNet's."

At the end of the day, I'm not against anyone who is against any isp, nor am I concerned in speaking up for Singtel.

To be fair the multi-threaded performance of i7 kaby is still faster than the i3 kopi but damn that's a i3(budget) outperforming an i7(top of the line). Intel also saying performance for notebooks, user can expect 40% better benchmarks/performance. Desktop cpu is about 11%. i think most manufacturers will also discontinue their current lineups and go with this chip once its out. So really doesn't make sense to get a kaby lake notebook now when it's at the end of it's cycle even tho it has only been a year. Intel probably pushing things to fight with AMD.

To me, ASUS has always been great in producing reasonable pricing ultrabooks based on specifications and design. I have always wanted to get a ASUS Zenbook UX410UQ (to replace my HP Pavilion DV4 which has been serving me for at least 8 years) after hearing so much good reviews from the guys in hwz in the IT Show 2017. My decision to purchase this laptop was only made after visiting the PC Show and CEE for 3 days. On 1st June, I have went to both PC Show and CEE to take a look on all the laptops and have fixed my mind to get ASUS Zenbook UX410UQ due to the reasonable pricing and its ability to further upgrade ram and harddisk although it is an ultrabook. On 2nd June, I have went to CEE to enquire on the UX410UQ price since most forumers mentioned CEE has the best price and are more open to negotiations. Although the prices in CEE are really attractive, I was thinking to give a try at PC Show, hoping to get even a more better price. On 3rd June, I went to the PC Show and surprisingly, the ASUS promoter from BD gave me an incredible price. During that time I was pretty unsure if I am hearing the right thing since it is very noisy. However once the promoter wrote the price on the brochure, I immediately told him I will get one from him without thinking twice. I strongly believed I really got the best price for the ASUS UX410UQ-GV024T. I will like to thank the promoter for the ""unbelievable"" price and I really glad I made the right choice to give the retailers in PC Show a chance to prove that they can sell cheaper than CEE. Overall, I am glad I have finally got my dream laptop at an unbelievable"" price! Thank to PC Show, CEE and HWZ."

First of all, I got a new Epson L655 from the pc show I am starting uni soon, and my faithful Epson L355, which has served me faithfully for nearly 4 to 5 years, had started to complain about ink pads being full, and the print quality was starting to dip. Since my previous Epson L series printer has done so well, and I had spare bottles of Epson coloured ink (these ink bottles seriously take nearly 10 months to actually finish!), I decided to take on its more advanced brother, the Epson L655. It not only gives quality, cheap printing, but now also makes the black prints waterproof (with its slightly more expensive black ink formula), adds on an auto-document feeder (ADF) and now I can swiftly send any documents I scan to my email seamlessly! For the price (and amount of documents I foresee to print when uni starts),  it's a great bargain and a no brainer to continue with Epson L series ink tanks! Before the Epson  l355 which I used before, I was using a HP photostat printer - and had to buy all colour and black ink cartridges every quarter - thus costing me 100 per trip and spending nearly 400 dollars per year on ink alone. It was crazy. Never looked back once I swapped to Epson's ink tank printers. I switched the moment it was sold in the pc show. I remember only filling up the l355's ink tanks 3 times in 4 years. Since the first fill was free (a full bottle of each colours ink is included), this meant that over 4 years, I spent 90 dollars TOTAL for ink. Best investment ever! Beat that HP! My second purchase in the pc show is a HP Omen! I wanted a laptop which was fast and responsive, Could do some light duty gaining and not break the bank. This laptop model filled my needs perfectly! Featuring a quad core i7 processor, a free upgrade to 16gb ram and a full 512GB ssd drive in it, it, to me, was the model TO GET. at 1669 with a free bump to 3 years warranty, i got it immediately. I imagine that the laptop would be a beast when multitasking and working on uni projects, and would fulfill my gaming needs as well (since I am a casual (racing) gamer and I don't want to fork out obscene amounts of cash just for racing on the need for speed Race tracks). I'm not convinced that it is the best deal around (since I didn't cross check with many other booths), but I'm sure this was one of the better deals. Oh. And just look at the red glowing backlit keyboard! O-Men, this makes the laptop look good as well! And finally my 3rd purchase - the creative iroar! Let me show of its size against the faux carbon fibre hood of my Hp omen... The old creative soundblaster roar 1 has served me well all these years (I was one of the fee to purchase it when it was first released), and this time, creative has not only lowered it's asking price for the creative iRoar (the 3rd generation successor in the roar series), but also done a trade in opportunity as well! Together with the voucher discount (actually you don't need a voucher, just ask their salesperson for a free voucher&#128514 , and $100 trade in for the old roar, I spent only 199 to get my hands on an iRoar. Believe me when I say this one was a massive improvement - louder sound, better bass and killer battery life, all coming from a small dictionary sized package! No regrets Other thoughts: I didn't go to the CEE, and went straight for the pc show even though some said the laptop deals in CEE were great. That was because the big boys like creative weren't in CEE. I personally felt these 2 shows shouldn't have been held at the same time. It's just splitting the crowd and and causing unnecessary confusion among consumers. As a comparatively newer show, the CEE should be held either before or after the pc show. If consumers feel it's worth it,I'm sure they could have gone for the CEE. But by holding both on the same day and effectively splitting the crowd, experienced hands like me will skip CEE altogether and just go for the tried and tested PC Show exhibition. Where got time to go to 2 shows?! Just my 2 cents."

After doing some research, I decided on the ASUS Vivobook S510. It is a very slim, lightweight and stylish laptop. The screen boasts a full HD 15.6 inch display with an ultrathin benzel and I like this aspect of the laptop the most as a good screen is essential for watching movies, and coupled with ASUS's SonicMaster technology, I really enjoy watching movies on my new laptop now. Despite its slim form, the laptop also manages to pack in a Nvidia GeForce GTX940 discrete graphics and a 1TB mechanical hard drive. To top it off, the laptop is powered by the latest 7th-generation Intel Core i7 processor. Last but not least, it is also a laptop which I can easily carry around and use on the go. I have been using my laptop for the past couple of days now and my overall impression so far: Amazing laptop, excellent value for money! I am extremely pleased with my purchase."

I'll post it up later. so should I upgrade? to mesh to solve my dead spot? Of course you should upgrade to wifi mesh.

Unless there is no upgrade within contract period, then it would have to take it as usual recontract case, as most provided free router.

Mesh can improve speed if you currently face a weak reception from your current router. Interference can also affect speed use a app to scan WiFi channels and choose the one with least interference."

Last year the GP battery staff told me to use the GP 8 hours battery charger (included in the above $11.8 pack) as follows : - connect it to your mobile phone charger via its micro-USB port. - charge them before going to sleep. - next morning when you wake up, the batteries will be fully charged. - the charger will auto-cut off the charging current when batteries are fully charged. So it is not really necessary to buy the more expensive quick charger pack. But of course, it does offer the extra flexibility if you're in a hurry. Good buy too."

EDIT-ADD-ON-2: ASUS F556UA-AB54 NB 15.6"" FHD Intel Core i5 8GB 256G SSD Windows 10 Laptop (Gold) USD $539.99 + $80.89 Shipping & Import Fees Deposit to Singapore ..... Total USD620.88 Changed to SGD using 1.5 = SGD 931.32 .......... Looks like a good deal. Does anyone know for this price, is there anything locally at the IT Show that is comparable? Thank you!"

Started at about same RRP but the last outgoing model was using 965M, 6700HQ + 256GB SATA SSD. The current omen may/may not be the drop-in replacement for the previous model. But RRP are very comparable. Freebies depends, but IIRC these are the HP sponsored gifts (not retailer's cost, means easy to get): -Mcafee 1 year - pretty sure Mcafee and HP still has the partnership going, retailers are given boxes of the activation key. If you open mouth ask for 3 years you can likely get -HP provided carrying case, most likely can get them throw in -The warranty extension etc are likely HP gifts as well than from retailer -Wireless mouse (retailer - generic brand?) most probably can get them throw in without affecting their margin much Stuff like nonsense freebies can decline (maybe insist on the cheapo mouse freebie cause it costs them like nothing), work your way easier up to a lower quote, imo cash discount more important. Depending on stocks, wouldn't hurt asking if pay by cash/nets can have any further discount than taking the respective 0% installment schemes. But overall need to check price from each retailer, find a part timer sales guy that's willing to open mouth ask the supervisor.

If you disassembled your own you can find the stamped markings over the interiors of the laptop. Wistron is a larger OEM and Foxconn stuff are a hit or miss. 4 year old thinkpad still working perfectly less one fan breakdown incident (common lenovo fan error). Asus uses Foxconn mostly. Consumer laptop build quality and QC are different from pro line, do not conflate. Also driver support you're looking at less than one year on consumer products and are in general more prone to planned obsolesence . While pro grade ones they'll have upgrades and fixes for years. There are some hardware in my thinkpad that are just Windows 7/10 compatible officially (even from hardware vendors like Intel), but for pro laptops they've extended the support to windows 10. Its a different ball game where consumer notebooks are more price performance oriented while pro laptops are focused on build quality and long term support including part availability. TPM security chip built in and there's option for smart card for some corporate requirements."

Still unsure if that pen and touchscreen will be useful for note taking or just a gimmick. Hmm. Oh and I took a look at Asus 330 i5 8gb ram 512gb ssd(!) and it only costs $1418 and comes with free Microsoft Office and Bluetooth speaker. Very attractive pricing especially the huge Ssd and 2 years warranty. It too comes with free  Microsoft Office, unlike the XPS13.  Urghhh. Decisions, decisions..... As far as freebies go, I dun find MS Office 1yr subscripton attractive, cos can download free Kingsoft WPS Office, which is pretty good and in some ways better than MSO. Best freebie to hv is extended warranty and maybe anti-virus s/w. My HP Envy13(i5/8Gb/512GB) c/w 3 yr warranty @1169 @CEE with 3-yr McAfee. Been using it a few days now, love it.

It definitely meet ur specs requirement. As for i5, i believe u could get it at around 1.2k or less. As for battery life, i am quite satisfied with mine. i5 will definitely consume less battery than my i7. And also long battery life really really depends on how you use it. I really dont see why ppl getting 720s which is heavier at 1.55kg bc of the graphic card. And xps 15 is more expensive if u care abt the pricing. Lastly, the design was nice, very slim. I was thinking the same thing I got the 720s because it has a nicer keyboard than the 710s,supposedly a better battery life and bigger screen. It's heavier, which I am disappointed in but so far it has been solid for me."

It didn't go out of stock during the PC Show actually. At least, there was no indication that stocks were running low when I bought mine around 7.30pm on Sunday. I originally went on Thursday but the rep told me stocks would only arrive on Saturday. I actually intended to ask for the display set in hopes of at least a $200 discount (I had all along planned to get the FHD version with lower specs, alas they only launched the one with the highest specs), but there was no display set at the booth and anyway they offered me $200 off for a new set. I figured since it just launched (in fact the manufacturing date on the box was 28 May - just 1 week before I bought it!), if there is any discount 3 months later at Comex, it's unlikely to be much more. And by then I would have gotten enough use to make up for the difference in price. (Not to mention I almost got the Yoga 710 at the IT Show until I saw the announcement for the Yoga 720 - it was supposed to release in April - and decided to wait. It's been 2 months and I'm not willing to wait another 3!) Important note though: the Lenovo Active Pen 2 is actually included in the box. I was very surprised as all the reviews I read from overseas purchasers mentioned that their unit did not come with a pen; in fact the Active Pen 2 is not even on the market yet."

The S2718H has a glass panel finishing, so you will get some light reflection, how much (bad) will depends on where you place the monitor, thinner bezel, more solid-looking and has provision behind for wall-mounting bracket. The S2717H is cheaper, like someone said, can get at $219 from Lazada (I got it at exactly $219, from Lazada too). It is matt-screen, so there is no light reflection problem, good for doing work (Word, Excel etc..) not that vibrant for video. There is not provision for wall mount at its back. And finally, it has a cheapo-plastic feel to it. Doesn't feels like a Dell, feels more like a unknown brand monitor with a Dell logo stick on it. But it is a Dell. I can't really do a side-by side comparison because the S21718H is at my workplace and the S2717H is at home. Both monitors' height cannot be adjusted, you can only tilt them."

Absolutely . If you play fast-paced, competitive games, the responsive feel of a 100Hz+ monitor with a sub 4ms response time is undeniable and can bring a real competitive advantage. Be honest with yourself, though. If you don\u2019t actually play competitive multi-player games \u2013 particularly FPS \u2013 then you\u2019re better off prioritising image quality over refresh rate and response time. Indeed, that\u2019s why the likes of the  Asus PG279Q and Acer XF270HU have proved so popular: they strike the perfect compromise between all these factors. done. I don't really bother much about refresh rates myself (thats why i prefer IPS) but most people in HWZ plays fps games and etc, it is better to recommend something which is better than ... otherwise. well, you get my point."

But the distance from edge of hole to edge of VESA plate is undefined and thus makers may make it bigger or smaller. I experienced a similar case whereby my wall mount plate was unable to fit into my current samsung S27D850T. The plate's overall dimension is slightly bigger than the VESA hole in the monitor. But when i use Prism+ ARC desk mount, the plate was able to fit in with some allowance as the overall dimensions are slightly smaller than the VESA hole in the monitor. For the C32HG70, Samsung provided an adaptor so as to fit VESA plates. The VESA part will protrube out of the monitor so it should not be an issue. But for the ASUS one, the VESA hole is circular which is a concern for me. Samsung VESA mounting: ASUS VESA mounting: Of coz, if one does not plan to use any desk or wall mount, ignore my wall of text."

I didn't ask what the content quality is though. If one's eyes can notice the difference in quality and the difference is that disconcerting, then by all means. But this is not some ISO standard or written law. Irks me when people empirically declare that 24"" is only good for 1080p and below while 27"" requires 1440p and above. Maybe its just me but i went from 22"" 1080p to 27"" 1080p and hardly notice a difference. And if its really that bad as some people make it out to be, then why are manufactureres still producing 1080p monitors between 27-35 inch? So the bottomline is to go have a look and decide for youself how comfortable you are with the size/resolution of the monitor."

But this is not some ISO standard or written law. Irks me when people empirically declare that 24"" is only good for 1080p and below while 27"" requires 1440p and above. Maybe its just me but i went from 22"" 1080p to 27"" 1080p and hardly notice a difference. And if its really that bad as some people make it out to be, then why are manufactureres still producing 1080p monitors between 27-35 inch? So the bottomline is to go have a look and decide for youself how comfortable you are with the size/resolution of the monitor. Ic. Thanks for the info.

There is always the choice not to force yourself into buying if you cant decide or is in no desperate need for a new monitor. If your budget is tight or main consideration, just buy whichever is the cheapest. If you have an open budget, buy according to your needs i.e. if you cant acommadate bigger than 27"" then stick to below 27"". Next, consider any brand preference or brand reputation. If all else fails, seriously consider not making the purchase for now. Found this new listing on qoo10 for a korean brand 27"" 1440p 144hz monitor sold by korean seller.

Bought a laptop from a particular vendor at the IT show. (1) Was advised that the local warranty given by themselves is 3 months. But upon researching after purchase, I realized the original product warranty (manufacturer based in HK) is 1 year.  My question is are the local retailers allowed to give a shorter warranty as they deem fit? - I cannot use the HK warranty because it says it is not available for overseas merchandise, something along that line. (2) The original packaging is supposed to come with a free TF/sd card. But during the show the sales person said that it does not come with it - sure at least he/she was upfront about it. And true enough when I opened the packaging at home the TF/sd card was already removed from the packaging (even though there is a sticker saying TF card inside).  Are these local retailers allowed to amend the contents of the packaging? Can I demand for the items to be complete or ask for refund instead? Also, how do I check and ensure that the product I receive is not a refurbished (or used) item? What do I look out for? Internally (software) or externally (seals, etc). Appreciate all your help."

It's called parallel goods. Manufacturer's warranty doesn't apply for parallel goods. Even if they have a local office, they will not honour the warranty if it's not a local set. Any personal warranty given by the seller is up to them, they can even not give any personal warranty. You can only kpkb and make noise if they misled you into thinking its a local set and covered by local manufacturer warranty 2) If they already told you about any missing stuffs with the package, and you opt to deal with them anyway, then there's nothing you can complain about with regards to the said missing content. Generally I would only deal with this kind of retailers with paralllel goods if the price is really, really attractive."

It should be fine to approach those brands manned by superstores and bargain hard. Example, for a $949 lappy selling at $899 at the show, I will upfront tell the promoter to ask his store manager/staff to give me at $800 with no freebies. It may work sometimes. The senior promoters always know the lowest they can go since their comms are the same whatever the price he sold that unit for. The superstores are as competitive as newstead, or even better.

Claire C at 12:02, Mar 14: Hi, my name is Claire, your Online Sales Consultant, and I am here to help you with your online purchase. You at 12:03, Mar 14: Hi Claire, I would like to check the recovery fee and early termination fee, given my contract ends on 9 Apr 2017. Claire C at 12:04, Mar 14: Sure. I'll be happy to assist you to check the Early Upgrade fee of your mobile line today. Claire C at 12:07, Mar 14: Upon seeing here, you are currently subscribed to Combo 2 plan, correct? You at 12:07, Mar 14: Yes Claire C at 12:08, Mar 14: There is no Early Upgrade Charge if will re-contract your mobile line today. You at 12:08, Mar 14: What about porting out to other Telco operators? Claire C at 12:09, Mar 14: With regards to that, I'm not guaranteeing it if there is charges since this will depends on the other service provider. You at 12:10, Mar 14: Singtel Recovery Fee Calculator page states $38 for a Combo 2 with 1 month remaining. You at 12:10, Mar 14: Is the fee charged by Singtel or the next Telco, in fact? Claire C at 12:12, Mar 14: If you will re-contract today with Singtel, there is no other charges since your contract is eligible to re-contract today and it is already reached 23 months. Claire C at 12:12, Mar 14: However, for other Telco, I cannot guarantee it. You at 12:13, Mar 14: Putting penalty incurred by the other Telco aside, what will Singtel charge to me if I port to other Telco before 9 April 2017? Claire C at 12:15, Mar 14: I understand that you want to know more about the charges however, I cannot guarantee it now online since Singtel will be the one who will communicate to other Telco to port in your number. You at 12:16, Mar 14: In this case, may I know what is this page about? You at 12:16, Mar 14: https://www.singtel.com/personal/i/s.../recoveryfees# You at 12:16, Mar 14: Recovery Fee is about mobile device, which has nothing to do with number porting. Claire C at 12:17, Mar 14: This is only for customer needs to cancel their plan and is unable to fulfill the Minimum Subscription Period. You at 12:17, Mar 14: Does a porting consider premature cancellation before minimum subscription period? Claire C at 12:19, Mar 14: As far as we know, this is only for customers who want to cancel their existing plan.However, if you want to know more charges about porting to another service provided, I recommend you to contact our Singtel Hotline at 1688. You at 12:21, Mar 14: Okay, let's assume that I am not porting to anyone, and I just want to cancel my plan 26 days before contract ends. How much Recovery Fee / Penalty / Miscellaneous Fees do I have to pay, according to my existing plan? Claire C at 12:23, Mar 14: A recovery fee of $38 is required. You at 12:23, Mar 14: Any other early termination fee / penalty on top of that? Claire C at 12:24, Mar 14: There is no early termination fee for this. You at 12:25, Mar 14: Is $38 the final number? I obtained the same amount using Recovery Fee Calculator, but happened to read a disclaimer that ""the actual amount will only be confirmed after your downgrade/termination request is submitted to Singtel"". Claire C at 12:26, Mar 14: Yes, you are correct. You at 12:26, Mar 14: Got it. You at 12:27, Mar 14: Perhaps you may help me more in the next question. How much will be the full 24-month package if I were to recontract with an iPhone 7 128GB under Combo 2 (Caller ID enabled)? You at 12:28, Mar 14: I wish to know whether there is any ongoing handset discount applicable for my case. Claire C at 12:29, Mar 14: Let me calculate it. Claire C at 12:30, Mar 14: The Iphone 7 128Gb will be entitled for $150 handset discount if you will re-contract Combo 3 and above mobile plan. You at 12:31, Mar 14: Combo 2? You at 12:32, Mar 14: I meant, how about Combo 2 under CIS? Claire C at 12:33, Mar 14: This is not available for Combo 2 plan. Claire C at 12:34, Mar 14: It is only applicable for Combo 3 and above plan. You at 12:34, Mar 14: $30 discount for selected handset? Claire C at 12:35, Mar 14: $30 discount is available only for selected phone only. Claire C at 12:35, Mar 14: Apple Iphone 7 and Iphone 7 plus is not included. You at 12:36, Mar 14: How about the $100 handset discount on CIS Combo Mobile Plan that I read in the company email? You at 12:36, Mar 14: *CIS Combo 2 Mobile Plan Claire C at 12:37, Mar 14: Oh, this $100 handset discount has been ended. Claire C at 12:37, Mar 14: It is valid from March 10-12 only. Claire C at 12:38, Mar 14: But currently, we do offer $150 OFF for 128GB/256GB iPhone 7 and 7 Plus on Combo 3 plan and above and $60 OFF 32GB iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. You at 12:40, Mar 14: Yes, you have stated that. You at 12:41, Mar 14: So, I want to know how much is the total commitment for my phone and my monthly fee under Combo 2. You at 12:42, Mar 14: Is the phone price still at $724? Claire C at 12:44, Mar 14: Combo 2 plan monthly subscription is $34.31. Claire C at 12:45, Mar 14: The upfront fee will still be $724. You at 12:45, Mar 14: 724 + 34.31 * 24 + zero admin fee + free Caller ID = $1547.44. Is that correct? Claire C at 12:46, Mar 14: The monthly subscription will be reflect on your next billing. Claire C at 12:46, Mar 14: While the upfront fee will be upon delivery. Claire C at 12:47, Mar 14: And there is no charge on Administration Fee when you sign up or re-contract online. Claire C at 12:48, Mar 14: Free cAller Id and autoroam that is valid for customers who sign up for a new line (including port-in) or re-contract with a 24-month mobile subscription on any CIS Combo Mobile Plan. You at 12:49, Mar 14: So, $1547.44? Claire C at 12:50, Mar 14: The total will be $1547.44. Claire C at 12:51, Mar 14: However, I have mentioned the monthly subscription will be reflected on your next billing. Claire C at 12:51, Mar 14: The upfront fee or the handset itself is upon delivery. You at 12:52, Mar 14: Let me think about it before deciding whether to recontract. Thanks Claire. Tl,dr: - For a 26-day early termination of Combo 2, Singtel charges $38 Recovery Fee and No Early Termination Penalty . - Porting fee is subject to the next telco's (in this case, M1's) discretion. - No incentive for being loyal ( M1 offers $150 off for port-in to 1Lite+ package , but Singtel simply told me that no discount at the moment and kept hardselling something that I don't want at all). As of now, without considering Caller Number Display, Admin Fee, SIM Card Fee, and Porting Fee, M1 package is at $1389 while Singtel package is at $1547.44. Need to confirm these fees in both M1 shop and ITSHOW (no CORI application available via online)."

I also had the ASUS RT-N66U. It is a serious bottleneck for the 300Mbps Fibre over WiFi, that's why I had to upgrade to ASUS RT-AC1200G+. RT-AC1200G+ on 2X2 AC WiFi is up to 380Mbps, can't reach 500Mbps but much closer already. Mobile on 802.11ac also get considerable speed boost, >250Mbps for capable devices. FYI: RT-N66U over 2X2 802.11n 5GHz WiFi can only get up to 240Mbps. 2X2 MIMO configuration is for laptops, for mobile it is mostly up to 120Mbps only due to 1X1 configuration. (I upgraded to the RT-AC1200G+, knowing that it will be capable of getting the full 300Mbps Fibre. No point getting AC68U/88U with the speed tbh.) kopicgao wrote: Oh dear! Thanks for pointing it out.

It is part of the contract. You can recontract after 20 months of the contract, so it can be as low as $100 for the router. Of course, the contract is for 24 months, so it can cost up to $120. for-kel wrote: Yes RT-N56U desktop using WiFi (5g I think) Maybe your WiFi settings for 5GHz is not optimized. If can, go to the web interface, go to WiFi settings -> Professional -> Set the 2.4GHz and 5GHz as 40MHz channel instead of 20/40MHz. It can potentially double your WiFi speed.

However, RMerlin confirmed that RT-AC66U B1 is the exact same firmware as the RT-AC68U, so there's still a possibility for the 66U B1 to get TurboQAM, maybe through the telnet modification. Note: RT-AC66U original do not have the same firmware as RT-AC66U B1 / RT-AC68U. It however have the same firmware as RT-N66U, which has the same internals except the 802.11ac radio.

The LAN/WAN max speed for the router is only 100Mbps, aka Fast Ethernet. Even if the router's Wireless performance is up to 300Mbps 802.11n, the bottleneck is the Ethernet speed.

The fixed line, you need to call SingTel to debundle the fixed line from the package before signing up on M1 Fibre. When signing up M1 Fibre, you need to tell the CSO that you want to port over your Fixed Line, and to sign the Fixed Number Portability (FNP) form.

Mandatory. Nobody ever gets it waived before. Reason: NetLink Trust charges them to hook up the Fibre from the operator to the premise.

But their pricing is, whatever cash pricing, add 3-5% of the pricing quoted. Then monthly payment through your CC statement is 0% installment plan through bills. There is absolutely no reasons to even consider buying from shows, even though they can give you $100 off the brochure pricing. Cause this type of pricing they give on brochure is still expensive than the above mentioned shops that are giving this type of discounts on a daily basis. This is where i noticed, example..... Fujifilm XF16mm F1.4 R Lens is SRP $1599. On brochure for show it is $150 off cash back. So in shows they are going to sell at $1449. When all the other shops are selling at $136X-$1370. Even if you add CC payment of 3% it is still cheaper than buying from show."
